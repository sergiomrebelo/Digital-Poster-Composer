# Digital-Poster-Composer
The wood-type posters, the primordial medium of communication during the Industrial Evolution era, are characterized by a new kind of typographic exploration and layout. These posters, mostly typographic, were composed with the most disruptive and innovative typefaces and layouts by a composer (i.e. a designer of the nineteen century) while interacting with the client. Based on this metaphor, we present a proposal to an evolutionary system able to generate artificial wood-type posters, from a text input, i.e. a composer. In this work, we develop an evolutionary system wherein individuals are composed by a set of stylized textboxes, which are shaped in order to produce a poster design. To assign fitness we resort a semi-autonomous scheme set by a hardwired measures and user guided measures. This scheme is defined by three main aesthetics measures: (1) composition, i.e., if the poster is well-composed according to specific features of wood-type posters; (2) design, i.e., if the poster is graphical appealing; and (3): the client, i.e., if the result satisfies the user. We analyse the experimental results in terms of fitness appropriateness and poster appearance. The results show the ability of the system to iteratively evolve a poster design and the impact of the user pre-defined criteria in the results.
